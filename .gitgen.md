This project, git gen, utilizes Node and TypeScript to generate new features in a git repository. The tech stack includes Node for runtime and TypeScript for type checking and compilation.

Coding conventions and patterns are derived from recent commits and the file tree. The project follows a minimalist design, with a focus on simplicity and scannability. Directory structure guidance can be inferred from the existing file layout, with related files grouped together.

New features should match existing patterns by:

1. Studying recent diffs to understand coding patterns, naming conventions, and style.
2. Analyzing the project structure from the file list and context.
3. Listing each file to create or modify.
4. Describing changes needed for each file, matching the project's established patterns.

The workflow for generating new features involves creating a branch, generating files, reviewing changes, committing, and pushing. The `git gen` command is used for all operations, with options available for customizing the generation process.
