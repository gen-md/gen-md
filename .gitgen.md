# git gen - Generative git

## Project Overview
git gen is a tool that utilizes Node and TypeScript to generate new features in a git repository. It leverages git's extension mechanism, allowing users to generate code that matches the project's existing patterns and style. The project aims to simplify the development process by automating the creation of new features, reducing the time spent on repetitive coding tasks.

The tool reads the project's context, including git history, file structure, and recent commits, to understand the coding patterns, naming conventions, and style. It then uses this information to generate new code that blends in with the existing codebase.

## Tech Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Build Tool**: TypeScript Compiler (tsc)
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest

## Architecture
### gitgen.ts (`./gitgen.ts`)
This is the main entry point of the application, responsible for handling user commands and generating new code.

### src/learn/index.ts (`./src/learn/index.ts`)
This module contains the logic for analyzing the project's context and generating code based on the learned patterns.

### src/providers/index.ts (`./src/providers/index.ts`)
This module provides support for multiple LLM providers, allowing users to choose their preferred provider for code generation.

## Coding Conventions

### File Organization
- `src/` - Source code for the application
- `tests/` - Unit tests and integration tests
- `prompts/` - Prompt files for different commands

### Naming
- Functions: camelCase (e.g., `generateFeature`)
- Types/Interfaces: PascalCase (e.g., `FeatureGenerator`)
- Files: kebab-case (e.g., `gitgen.ts`)
- Constants: uppercase with underscores (e.g., `MAX_FILE_SIZE`)

### Code Style
- Use strict TypeScript mode
- Use ES2022 syntax features
- Keep lines shorter than 120 characters
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)

### Commit Style
- Use conventional commit messages (e.g., `feat: add new feature`)

## Adding New Features
To add new features to the project, follow these guidelines:

1. **Study recent diffs**: Analyze recent commits to understand the coding patterns, naming conventions, and style used in the project.
2. **Analyze the project structure**: Look at the file tree and directory organization to understand how different components are structured.
3. **List each file to create or modify**: Identify the files that need to be created or modified to implement the new feature.
4. **Describe changes needed for each file**: Explain the changes required for each file, matching the project's established patterns and style.

### Example: Adding a new command
```typescript
// Add a new command to the gitgen.ts file
async function generateNewCommand(
  feature: string,
  options: { [key: string]: any }
): Promise<void> {
  // Implement the logic for the new command
}
```
Remember to keep the code concise, readable, and consistent with the project's style. Use proper naming conventions, and follow the guidelines outlined above.
